# Leaf Cleanups Made Easy 🍂

We make leaf removal simple and efficient. Our crew of **2 or more technicians** will come to your property with a [**leaf collection machine**](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/17oQpdeA2J/) to gather and remove leaves thoroughly.

- **Leaves are bagged** and placed at your **curb for city pickup**.  
- **Leaves that can’t be bagged** will be **mulched on-site** for a clean finish.  
- Pricing is **$120/hour**. Most jobs take **1–2 hours**, though we’ve done cleanups lasting up to **8 hours**.
